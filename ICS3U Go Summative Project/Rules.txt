There are two sides in this game: Black and White. Each side is given stones respective to their side (Black with Black stones and White with White stones) and they are to place them on the intersections of a board that is provided. The board in this game is composed of a 9 by 9 grid which means it has a total of 81 intersections that can be filled in. Black starts first. When a stone is placed in an empty intersection, it starts with 4 liberties (blank intersections that are laterally and vertically adjacent to it). Once a stone of the opposite color is placed next to it (laterally or vertically adjacent), it ends up with 3 liberties but it takes up one of the liberties of the other stone that was placed. But, if a stone of the same color as a stone already on the board is placed next to it, the amount of liberties is counted based on how many free spaces surround those two stones. Once a stone or a group of stones are surrounded by stones of the opposite color so that the stone/ the group of stones don’t
have anymore liberties, the stone/ the group of stones are removed off the board and the territory is claimed by the side that surrounded the stone(s). After you click end match, the score is calculated based on how many stones you have (Stone Counting rules). Whoever has the most stones wins.
